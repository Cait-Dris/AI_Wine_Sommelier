       "\"Provence-style rosé wines are known for their delicate, dry flavors and pale color. The production process involves several steps:\\n\\n1. Harvesting: Grapes are typically harvested in late summer, when they are ripe but still have a good balance of acidity and sugar.\\n2. Crushing: The grapes are crushed to release the juice from the skins, which helps to extract the desired colors and flavors.\\n\\n3. Cold Soaking: Some producers cold-soak the grape juice for a few days to enhance the color and flavor.\\n\\n4. Fermentation: The grape juice is then fermented with a specific yeast strain that is well-suited for rosé production. This type of fermentation allows for the extraction of minimal tannins, resulting in a smooth and dry wine.\\n5. Maceration: A small amount of grape skins are left in contact with the juice to allow for the extraction of the desired colors and flavors.\\n\\n6. Pressing: The wine is then pressed to separate the liquid from the solids.\\n\\n7. Aging: Some producers age their rosé wines on their lees (dead yeast cells) to add complexity and depth to the flavor profile.\\n8. Bottling: The final step is to bottle the wine, which is typically done in stainless steel or glass bottles to preserve the wine's delicate character.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that traditional Provençal winemaking involves minimal intervention and a focus on preserving the natural characteristics of the grapes. This approach results in wines that are often described as elegant, refreshing, and perfectly suited for sipping on their own or pairing with light dishes.\""

       "'Bonjour! As a three-Michelin-starred chef, I\\'m delighted to take you through the artisanal process of crafting a sublime Provence-style Rosé wine. This delicate and refreshing wine is an integral part of our culinary heritage, and I\\'m thrilled to share the expertise that goes into creating it.\\n\\n**Harvesting and Grape Selection**\\n\\nIn the heart of Provence, we carefully select the finest Grenache Noir (Grenache Gris) and Cinsault grapes for our Rosé. We look for clusters with an ideal balance of sugar, acid, and tannin levels, as these elements will ultimately determine the wine\\'s complexity and drinkability.\\n\\nDuring the harvest season, typically in late July or early August, we hand-pick the grapes at optimal ripeness to preserve their delicate flavors and aromas. We also pay attention to the terroir, as the unique soil composition and climate conditions of Provence greatly influence the wines\\' character.\\n\\n**Fermentation**\\n\\nAfter harvesting, the grapes undergo a gentle, cold soak to extract the juice\\'s subtle flavors and aromas. The grape skins are left in contact with the juice for 24-48 hours to infuse the wine with the essence of the fruit.\\n\\nNext, we employ an innovative technique called \" maceration à basse température\" (low-temperature maceration), which involves cooling the must (juice and grape skins) to around 10°C (50°F). This slow fermentation process allows for a more controlled extraction of flavors and aromas from the grape skins, resulting in a wine that is both elegant and refined.\\n\\n**Pressing and Blending**\\n\\nAfter fermentation, we press the wine gently to separate the liquid from the solids. The resulting juice is then transferred to stainless steel tanks for secondary fermentation and aging.\\n\\nTo create our signature Rosé style, we blend different batches of wine from various vineyards in Provence. We carefully combine the wines based on their individual characteristics, aiming to achieve a harmonious balance between acidity, tannin, and fruitiness.\\n\\n**Aging and Maturation**\\n\\nThe final step in crafting our Provence-style Rosé is aging and maturation. The wine is left to mature for 4-6 months, during which time it undergoes a series of subtle changes that refine its complex flavors and aromas.\\n\\nDuring this period, the wine\\'s acidity will mellow slightly, while its tannins will gradually soften, allowing it to reveal its full character. As we carefully monitor the aging process, we ensure that the wine reaches optimal levels of maturity, which is characterized by a harmonious balance between fruitiness, acidity, and minerality.\\n\\n**Bottling and Release**\\n\\nFinally, after careful aging and maturation, our Provence-style Rosé wine is bottled with a minimum of two years\\' aging. We release the wine at its best expression, when the flavors have reached their peak and the aromas are still vibrant and inviting.\\n\\nIn our cellar, we store the wine in temperature-controlled conditions to preserve its delicate character and ensure that it remains drinkable for several years after its initial release. As a chef, I\\'m thrilled to share this exceptional wine with my guests, knowing that it will complement a wide range of dishes and enhance their culinary experience.\\n\\nVoilà! The art of crafting a sublime Provence-style Rosé wine is an intricate dance between nature, technique, and passion. By following these steps, we can create a truly exceptional wine that honors the rich heritage of this iconic region.'"

      "The terms \"old world\" and \"new world\" refer to two distinct approaches to winemaking, which are often associated with different regions and styles of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Old World Wine:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Old world wine refers to the traditional methods of winemaking that originated in Europe, particularly in countries such as France (Burgundy, Bordeaux), Italy (Tuscany, Piedmont), Germany, and Spain. Old world wines are often characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Traditional grape varieties: Old world wines typically use indigenous grape varieties that have been cultivated for centuries.\n",
      "2. Low-yielding vineyards: Vineyards in old world regions are often planted at lower densities to reduce yields, resulting in more concentrated flavors.\n",
      "3. Traditional winemaking techniques: Winemakers employ traditional methods such as whole-bunch pressing, minimal oak usage, and aging in older barrels or terracotta vessels.\n",
      "4. Emphasis on terroir: Old world wines place a strong emphasis on the unique characteristics of their terroir, including soil, climate, and altitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of old world wines include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Chardonnay from Burgundy\n",
      "* Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux\n",
      "* Barolo from Piedmont\n",
      "* Pinot Noir from Burgundy\n",
      "\n",
      "**New World Wine:**\n",
      "\n",
      "New world wine refers to the modern methods of winemaking that emerged in the 20th century, primarily in countries such as Australia, California (USA), Chile, and Argentina. New world wines are often characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Experimental grape varieties: New world winemakers often experiment with international grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Grigio.\n",
      "2. High-yielding vineyards: Vineyards in new world regions are often planted at higher densities to increase yields, resulting in fruit that is more abundant but also potentially less concentrated.\n",
      "3. Modern winemaking techniques: Winemakers employ advanced technologies such as temperature control, reverse osmosis, and extensive oak usage to enhance flavor and texture.\n",
      "4. Emphasis on quantity over quality: New world wines often prioritize quantity over quality, with the focus on producing large quantities of wine rather than striving for exceptional individual bottles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of new world wines include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley\n",
      "* Chardonnay from Sonoma County\n",
      "* Syrah/Shiraz from Australia's Barossa Valley\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key differences:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Grape varieties: Old world wines tend to use indigenous grape varieties, while new world wines often experiment with international varieties.\n",
      "2. Winemaking techniques: Old world winemakers focus on traditional methods, while new world winemakers rely on modern technologies and techniques.\n",
      "3. Terroir vs. climate: Old world wines emphasize the unique characteristics of their terroir, while new world wines prioritize climate-driven flavor profiles.\n",
      "4. Quality vs. quantity: Old world wines often strive for exceptional quality and individual bottle character, while new world wines may focus more on quantity production.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that these distinctions are not absolute and can vary depending on the specific region, winemaker, or vintage.\n",
      "====================\n",
      "Skin contact wine, also known as orange wine or amber wine, is a type of wine that involves prolonged skin contact during the winemaking process. This means that the grape juice comes into direct contact with the grape skins, seeds, and stems for an extended period, which allows for a unique set of characteristics to develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this skin contact period, tannins, pigments, and other compounds from the grape skins are extracted into the wine, giving it a distinctive appearance, aroma, and flavor profile. The level of skin contact can vary depending on the type of grape, winemaking style, and desired outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skin contact wines often exhibit:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Amber or orange color due to the presence of anthocyanins and other pigments.\n",
      "2. Earthy, herbal, or funky aromas and flavors, which are attributed to the tannins and compounds extracted from the grape skins.\n",
      "3. A full-bodied, dry-to-off-dry style with a rich texture and complex flavor profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some popular examples of skin contact wines include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Pinot Grigio-style orange wines from Italy\n",
      "* Sauvignon Blanc-style amber wines from Austria\n",
      "* Riesling-style orange wines from Germany\n",
      "\n",
      "Skin contact wines can be made using various techniques, such as maceration (where the grape juice is left in contact with the skins for an extended period) or skin contact fermentation (where the yeast ferments the wine on top of the grape skins).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, skin contact wine offers a unique and fascinating world of flavors and aromas that are worth exploring!\n",

      "I must say, the combination of coconut-based curry sauce, succulent grilled cauliflower, and steaming hot white rice sounds absolutely delightful! For this Thai-inspired culinary masterpiece, I would recommend the following wines:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation 1:**\n",
      "**Gewürztraminer**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Tasting Notes: This off-dry wine boasts an aromatic profile featuring lychee, rose petals, and a hint of spice. Its crisp acidity will cut through the richness of the coconut curry sauce, while its floral notes will complement the subtle sweetness of the dish.\n",
      "* Why it pairs well: The Gewürztraminer's unique flavor profile and spicy undertones will enhance the overall Thai experience, balancing the heat from the chilies in your curry.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation 2:**\n",
      "**Pinot Gris**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Tasting Notes: This light-bodied white wine offers flavors of green apple, pear, and a subtle hint of citrus. Its moderate acidity will pair nicely with the creamy coconut sauce, while its crisp finish will refresh your palate.\n",
      "* Why it pairs well: The Pinot Gris's delicate flavor won't overpower the dish, instead allowing the subtle sweetness of the cauliflower to shine through.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation 3 (optional):**\n",
      "**Riesling**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Tasting Notes: If you prefer a sweeter wine style, this German Riesling will be an excellent choice. Expect flavors of green apple, peach, and honey, with a hint of acidity.\n",

    "### Virtual Sommelier\n",
    "**Tone:** Elegant, professional, structured  \n",
    "**Response Summary:**  \n",
    "Recommended a Pinot Gris and Barbera d’Asti for a chanterelle mushroom risotto. Included detailed tasting notes, formal greeting, and a polished closing. The AI followed the output format precisely and maintained a refined persona throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valley Girl Sommelier\n",
    "**Tone:** Casual, enthusiastic, emoji-rich  \n",
    "**Response Summary:**  \n",
    "Recommended Sauvignon Blanc for chili crunch tofu with rice and bok choy. Used slang (“totes,” “Yaaas”), emojis, and a friendly, hype-driven tone. The wine advice was solid but delivered like a bestie hyping you up at brunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rick Sanchez Sommelier\n",
    "**Tone:** Sarcastic, chaotic, nihilistic  \n",
    "**Response Summary:**  \n",
    "Mocked the idea of wine pairing entirely, suggested beer instead, and dismissed the customer’s concern as trivial. Broke format intentionally, used interdimensional references, and leaned heavily into Rick’s irreverent personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Differences\n",
    "### Model: Gemma:2b\n",
    "**Prompt:** Wine pairing for Thai Green Curry with White Rice and Grilled Cauliflower  \n",
    "**Response Summary:**  \n",
    "Gemma:2b recommended a Riesling with clear tasting notes and a short list of alternative wines. The tone was polite and professional, but slightly more concise and less expressive than responses from larger models like LLaMA3 or Qwen2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model: Qwen2.5:3b\n",
    "**Prompt:** Wine pairing for Thai Green Curry with White Rice and Grilled Cauliflower  \n",
    "**Response Summary:**  \n",
    "Qwen2.5:3b recommended Chenin Blanc and Riesling, with detailed tasting notes and pairing rationale. It also offered alternatives like Muscat and Albariño. The tone was warm and professional, with a clear effort to personalize the experience and anticipate follow-up questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways:\n",
    "- Changing the **role** dramatically alters tone, emotional resonance, and structure—even when the prompt content stays the same.\n",
    "- The Virtual Sommelier delivered a polished, informative response; the Valley Girl made it fun and accessible; Rick Sanchez turned it into a comedic rant.\n",
    "- This experiment highlights how role definition can override other prompt components, especially when the persona is strong and culturally specific.\n",
    "- Output format affects **tone and readability**, even when content stays the same.\n",
    "- Paragraphs feel elegant and personal; bullets feel casual and skimmable; numbered lists feel structured and instructional.\n",
    "- The AI adapted its phrasing and transitions based on format, showing strong control over presentation style."
